SOLAR SYSTEM 3D SIMULATION using UNITY
A 3D interactive solar system built in Unity featuring custom orbital mechanics, physics-based planet selection using raycasting, dynamic camera tracking, and a responsive UI. Includes smooth zoom controls, procedural rotation logic, and a fully modular C# architecture designed for scalability in AR/VR simulation environments.

What does this offer?

A 3D interactive Solar System built in Unity using C#.
This project simulates realistic planetary motion, user-controlled exploration, and physics-based interaction within a clean and modular architecture.
